# Compose image for development purposes.
# All changes inside /diaryspace will be synchronized to your host file system.
# You have to prepare all dependencies manually, such as preparing Yarn with its modules 
# and running `python manage.py collectstatic` to prepare static files.
# It is required since the project directory is mounted to /diaryspace,
# and we expect it to be ready to run the server.
